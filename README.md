## What Is This?

Everything Is Collateral (aka EverythingIsRuby) is the current implementation of my personal website written in Ruby on Rails. I've been working on it for quite a bit, creating and improving features as I go. In many ways, this is my means of exploring Ruby on Rails. 

That being said, I strive to keep the master branch as the most stable and secure branch. New feature branches will exist from time to time.

## What's it made out of?

As I mentioned before, this project is built with Rails. However, there are a few other things at play too!

(Listed in order of depth)

* Font-Awesome
* Twitter Bootstrapp (with LESS processing)
* Carrierwave with S3 Integration
* Rails
* PostgreSQL
