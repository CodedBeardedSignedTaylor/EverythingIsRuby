# Everything Is Collateral (http://everythingiscollateral.com)

## What Is This?

This a build out of my personal website and blog. There's really not much to it. However, you might be able to
find some really cool stuff nested within. This project acts like a exploratory sandbox (in some ways) for things
that interest me.

Previously, I had a pretty heavy dependence on Carrierwave + AWS S3. However, I'm currently reconsidering that
relationship. The past months or so have been spent on slimming down and updating the app.

## What's it made out of?

As I mentioned before, this project is built with Rails. However, there are a few other things at play too!

(Listed in order of depth)

* Font-Awesome
* Twitter Bootstrapp (with LESS processing)
* Rails
* PostgreSQL

## What's New With It?

Over the past couple of months, I've updated and improved the structure of the application. It hasn't been a
full rewrite, but I rewrite a lot of features.
