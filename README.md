# Hiimtaylorjones Personal Site

## What Is This?

This a build out of my personal website and blog. There's really not much to it. However, you might be able to find some really cool stuff nested within. This project acts like a exploratory sandbox (in some ways) for things that interest me.


## What's it made out of?

As I mentioned before, this project is built with Rails. However, there are a few other things at play too!

(Listed in order of depth)

* Bulma
* Rails
* PostgreSQL

## What's New With It?

Over the past couple of months, I've updated and improved the structure of the application. It hasn't been a full rewrite, but I rewrite a lot of features.
